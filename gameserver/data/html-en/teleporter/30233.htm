Gatekeeper Esmeralda:

I have heard that there are many monsters wandering near this Hunter's Village. For weary adventurers pressed for time, my ability to send you through the door of time and space may be invaluable.

Do you miss the hometown you left years ago? Are you in a hurry to save a friend? Or do you suddenly long to see the great ocean? I can send you anywhere on this wide continent in an instant.
